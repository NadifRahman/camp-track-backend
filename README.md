## Description
**Camp Track** is a software solution designed to help summer camp organizations better manage their operations. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Bootstrap 5 for front-end styling, the project is currently in the prototype stage. At this time, it serves only one organization, but future updates will enable multiple organizations to create their own "units" within the app.

I developed this full-stack project based on my experience working at a summer camp for three years. While the camp's software worked, it was not well-integrated. Separate services were used for camper registration, and camper information was not easily accessible. Inventory management lacked centralization, making it hard to keep track of items. Additionally, attendance was managed via Google Sheets, which, while functional, was not ideal for other data needs the camp might have in the future. These are the key issues my software aims to address.

### Planned Features:
- Audit log to track employee actions within the software
- Full-duplex communication using Socket.io
- Employee messaging mini-app
- Refactoring the app to use a relational database (PostgreSQL)
- Employee records management
- Job application feature
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Mobile app (the website is already mobile-friendly)

## How To Use

The software is currently deployed at [https://camptrack.vercel.app/](https://camptrack.vercel.app/).
